# 🌱 Low-Power Wireless Soil Moisture Monitoring System

This project implements a low-power wireless sensor network for monitoring soil moisture in smart agriculture. It uses Arduino Nano microcontrollers and NRF24L01 RF modules to wirelessly transmit real-time soil moisture data, helping optimize irrigation strategies and reduce water waste.

## ✨ Features

✅ Real-time soil moisture monitoring  
✅ Wireless data transmission via NRF24L01 modules  
✅ Local data display on OLED screen  
✅ Low-power design for extended battery life  
✅ Modular, easily customizable Arduino code
